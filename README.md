# Lesson 4.2 - String Concatenation

## Key Points
- A variable is a container for storing data values. E.g., `let variable;`
- Variables can store different data types including numbers and strings.
- A string is a series of characters or text. E.g., `let name = "Mario";`
- Strings are data types and are always enclosed in quotation marks (`""` or `''`).
- Strings and numbers are written differently. E.g., `"seven"` vs `7`.
- Only the `+` operator can be used to concatenate strings.
  
### Examples of String Concatenation
1. **Basic Concatenation:** 
   ```javascript
   let first = "Maria";
   let space = " ";
   let last = "Singh";
   console.log(first + space + last); // "Maria Singh"
   ```
2. **Concatenation with Variables:**
   ```javascript
   let food = "pizza";
   let sentence = "My favorite food is " + food;
   ```
